## 🔍 Error Detection & Resolution Summary

### 🚨 Issues Found & Fixed (4 Critical Errors Resolved)

#### 1. **Duplicate Export Functions** - ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `src/api/errorHandling.js`
- **Issue:** Duplicate function exports causing compilation errors
- **Solution:** Removed duplicate `handleNetworkError` and `handleBookingConflict` JSX-returning functions
- **Impact:** Eliminated compilation errors, restored clean build process

#### 2. **Missing ServiceGridSkeleton Component** - ✅ FIXED  
- **File:** `src/components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDirectory.jsx`
- **Issue:** Import reference to non-existent `ServiceGridSkeleton`
- **Solution:** Updated import to use existing `ServiceListSkeleton` component
- **Impact:** Resolved loading state functionality for service grid view

#### 3. **Missing ServiceDetailsSkeleton Component** - ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `src/components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDetails.jsx` 
- **Issue:** Import reference to non-existent `ServiceDetailsSkeleton`
- **Solution:** Updated import to use existing `SkeletonCard` component
- **Impact:** Fixed loading states for service detail views

#### 4. **Missing API Class Exports** - ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `src/api/index.js`
- **Issue:** Missing exports for core API management classes
- **Solution:** Added exports for `ServiceDataManager`, `ErrorHandler`, `DataSyncManager`, etc.
