# Frontend Error Detection and Resolution - Complete Report

## Summary
Successfully tested, identified, and fixed all errors in the frontend web dashboard. The application now builds successfully and runs without compilation errors.

## Errors Found and Fixed

### 1. ServiceDataManager Export Issue
**File:** `src/api/serviceDataManager.js`
**Problem:** Class was defined but only default instance was exported, not the class itself
**Solution:** Added named export `export { ServiceDataManager };`

### 2. useBooking Hook Missing
**File:** `src/api/booking.js` â†’ `src/api/booking.jsx`
**Problem:** ServiceDirectory component expected a React hook `useBooking` but it didn't exist
**Solution:** Created React hook wrapper around existing `submitBooking` function

### 3. DataSyncManager Export Issue
**File:** `src/api/dataSyncManager.js`
**Problem:** Class was defined but only default instance was exported
**Solution:** Added named export `export { DataSyncManager };`

### 4. ErrorHandler Export Issue
**File:** `src/api/errorHandling.js`
**Problem:** Complex file structure with corrupted exports
**Solution:** Recreated entire file with clean structure and proper exports

### 5. BookingProvider Missing
**File:** `src/api/booking.js` â†’ `src/api/booking.jsx`
**Problem:** App.jsx expected BookingProvider React context provider
**Solution:** Created BookingProvider component with React context

### 6. JSX Syntax in JavaScript File
**File:** `src/api/booking.js`
**Problem:** JSX components in .js file causing build errors
**Solution:** Renamed to `booking.jsx` and updated all imports

### 7. CacheManager Export Issue
**File:** `src/api/cacheManager.js`
**Problem:** Class was defined but only default instance was exported
**Solution:** Added named export `export { CacheManager };`

### 8. BookingManager Export Issue
**File:** `src/api/booking.jsx`
**Problem:** Class was defined but only default instance was exported
**Solution:** Added named export `export { BookingManager };`
